Rede
====

A visualisation tool based on [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) for probe pairs arising
in genome wide association studies.

Usage
-----

You can choose four different types of plots in the "plots" drop down box:

* Circular ideogram
* Manhattan plot
* Heat-map
* Arc plot

Interactive manipulation of data
-----------------------------------

The design philosophy behind Rede is to allow the user to interactively browse and manipulate the large graphs that represent epistatic interaction networks. 
These actions are collected into four groups that the user may wish to do while 
investigating biological epistasis.

* filter, e.g choose subset of probes, or filter by value of statistical test
* zoom, e.g. by click and drag on heatmap or by typing values in circular plot
* summarise, e.g. degree (number of edges) for each probe
* drill down, by linking to external resources such as the UCSC genome browser
