TO DO

- show contingency tables or statistics such as odds ratio in separate <div>
- graph with sensitivity on x axis, odds ratio on y axis and frequency of occurance as heatmap
- show SNPs association in histogram degree x SNPs replecing the color bar when a snps is selected 
- show each SNPs and their associations in a specific chrom when selected (examples in d3js.org) 
- put histogram edges x subgraph_id in matrix plot to show the subgraph selected in the matrix
- put the matrix SNPs X comunities in circle plot
- put zoom in big matrix SNPs associations (matrix plot)

LATER
- select subset for exporting to UCSC BED file
- http://jbrowse.org/ on separate <div>
- genes and SNPs collapsible layout http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html
