TO DO



- Cleanup code to follow google javascript style
- put the instructions for users in readme
- create public data

- show a specfic chromosome when clicking on it in circular plot. 
  Zoom such that it fills whole circle.
- sort SNP list options: chromosome, probe_graph, degree
- graph with sensitivity on x axis, odds ratio on y axis and frequency of occurance as heatmap

LATER

- idea -> http://bl.ocks.org/4063582
- select subset for exporting to UCSC BED file
- http://jbrowse.org/ on separate <div>
- genes and SNPs collapsible layout http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html
- idea ->  http://www.jasondavies.com/coffee-wheel/

DONE

- (4/3/2013) create the plot  matrix SNPs X comunities
- (3/3/2013) It should be able to visualise files with no subgraphs or communities.
- (1/3/2013) replace in json file and here  subgraph_id for probe_group and comm_id for assoc_group
- (27/2/2013) hide and show ROC plot and Contegency table when click in title "ROC plot and Contegency table"
- (27/2/2013) conection betwen roc and ct's button with circle plot to show the pair in circle
- (25/2/2013) put zoom in big matrix SNPs associations (matrix plot) - mini map
- (21/2/2013) create a little box to help localization on the a big plot such as manhattan plot and matrix plot 
- (21/2/2013) It should be able to take in all type of statistics, given in the file, e.g. DSS, GSS. 
- (15/2/2013) plot ROC curve based on contingency table 
- (10/2/2013) show contingency tables or statistics such as odds ratio in separate <div> 
- (4/2/2013) the json file will not have "label". Replace "label" with "chrom" and "bp_position"
- (31/1/2013) put numbers in scale color bar in circle plot
- (31/1/2013) clear the matrix , removing numbers of the other plot
- (31/1/2013) hide the buttons in matrix view
- (30/1/2013) show SNPs association in histogram degree x SNPs replecing the color bar when a snps is selected 
- (29/1/2013) make the statistical test drop box work with brush in cicle plot and manhattan plot   
- (27/1/2013) created one drop box to statistical tests
- (23/1/2013) make brush show the association in the circle and text 
- (20/1/2013) created the code in python to read the  'snp_sig_sel2w.txt' and create a .json with diferent Stat. tests
- (17/1/2013) Use HTML5 for file upload http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
- (16/1/2013) make the histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot show the a subgraph selected
- (12/1/2013) create json file using link communities methodology
- (9/1/2013) refactoring all code to improve the organization
- (8/1/2013) make matrix show the snps associations datas in .json
- (7/1/2013) put button to load and save
- (5/1/2013) put histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot
- (4/1/2013) chrom. ordinal scale in manhattan plot
- (23/12/2012) put histogram degree x SNPs in circle plot
- (20/12/2012) color scale for degree in mahanttan plot
- (15/12/2012) show manhattan plots on separate <div>
- (15/12/2012) select threshold for interaction strength
- (10/12/2012) change format of location to UCSC genome browser format (chr2:31596785)
- (10/12/2012) show degree of vertex as tooltip
- (12/2012) ticks on chromosome 
- (12/2012) merge to one html with radio buttons (see view_graph.html)
- (12/2012) fade of subgraph (links not working)
- (12/2012) fade of SNPs and pairs in text
