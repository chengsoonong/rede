TO DO

- zoom with minimap
- show contingency tables or statistics such as odds ratio in separate <div>
- graph with sensitivity on x axis, odds ratio on y axis and frequency of occurance as heatmap
- genes and SNPs collapsible layout http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html
- idea ->  http://www.jasondavies.com/coffee-wheel/
- idea ->  http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/
- show SNPs association in histogram degree x SNPs replecing the color bar  
- make brush show the association
- show each SNPs and their associations in a specific chrom when selected (examples in d3js.org) 
- put histogram edges x subgraph_id in matrix plot to show the subgraph selected in the matrix
- Use HTML5 for file upload http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
- Select subgraph from histogram of subgraph sizes

LATER
- select subset for exporting to UCSC BED file
- http://jbrowse.org/ on separate <div>



DONE 

- (17/1/2013) fix the load with html5
- (16/1/2013) make the histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot show the a subgraph selected
- (12/1/2013) create json file using link communities methodology
- (9/1/2013) refactoring all code to improve the organization
- (8/1/2013) make matrix show the snps associations datas in .json
- (7/1/2013) put button to load and save
- (5/1/2013) put histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot
- (4/1/2013) chrom. ordinal scale in manhattan plot
- (23/12/2012) put histogram degree x SNPs in circle plot
- (20/12/2012) color scale for degree in mahanttan plot
- (15/12/2012) show manhattan plots on separate <div>
- (15/12/2012) select threshold for interaction strength
- (10/12/2012) change format of location to UCSC genome browser format (chr2:31596785)
- (10/12/2012) show degree of vertex as tooltip
- (12/2012) ticks on chromosome 
- (12/2012) merge to one html with radio buttons (see view_graph.html)
- (12/2012) fade of subgraph (links not working)
- (12/2012) fade of SNPs and pairs in text
