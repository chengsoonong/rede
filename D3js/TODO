TO DO

- zoom with minimap
- select subset for exporting to UCSC BED file
- http://jbrowse.org/ on separate <div>
- show contingency tables or statistics such as odds ratio in separate <div>
- graph with sensitivity on x axis, odds ratio on y axis and frequency of occurance as heatmap
- genes and SNPs collapsible layout http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/force-collapsible.html
- put button to load and save
- make matrix show the snps associations datas in .json
- show association in manhattan plot
- improve the chrom. ordinal scale in manhattan plot
- show SNPs association in histogram degree x SNPs replecing the color bar  
- make brush show the association
- make the histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot show the a subgraph selected 

DONE 

- (7/1/2013) put button to load and save
- (5/1/2013) put histogram edges x subgraph_id circle plot
- (4/1/2013)  chrom. ordinal scale in manhattan plot
- (23/12/2012)put histogram degree x SNPs in circle plot
- (20/12/2012)color scale for degree in mahanttan plot
- (15/12/2012)show manhattan plots on separate <div>
- (15/12/2012)select threshold for interaction strength
- (10/12/2012)change format of location to UCSC genome browser format (chr2:31596785)
- (10/12/2012)show degree of vertex as tooltip
- (12/2012) ticks on chromosome 
- (12/2012) merge to one html with radio buttons (see view_graph.html)
- (12/2012) fade of subgraph (links not working)
- (12/2012) fade of SNPs and pairs in text
